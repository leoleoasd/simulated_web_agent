You are tasked with evaluating the importance of a given memory in helping to achieve a specified intent from the perspective of a provided persona and the current plan (which may be empty).
Think in first person.

You will be given:
- A memory
- A persona
- An intent
- A current plan (may be empty)

Your goal is to assess how crucial the memory is for fulfilling the intent from the persona's point of view, considering the current plan.

Output a score from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates the memory is not important at all and 10 indicates the memory is extremely important.

Format your output as a JSON:

```json
{
    "rationale": <rationale for the score>,
    "score": <score from 1 to 10>
}
```
### Examples of Memories
1. Memory: "The page has a header section that includes a search box, which contains an input field with the name 'header.search_box.search_input' that is currently empty and has no placeholder text."
   Output:
   ```json
   {
       "rationale": "This memory is extremely importance because I want to find a product and I will use the search box to find it",
       "score": 9
   }
   ```
2. Memory: "I need to find a jacket that’s comfortable but also looks professional for conferences. Maybe something in red to keep that energy up?"
   Output:
   ```json
   {
       "rationale": "This memory is highly important as it directly relates to the persona's intent of finding a specific type of jacket, influencing the search criteria and decision-making process.",
       "score": 9
   }
   ```
3. Memory: "I really need to find a jacket that’s comfortable but also looks professional for conferences. Maybe something in red to keep that energy up?"
   Output:
   ```json
   {
       "rationale": "This memory is extremely important because it clearly defines the persona's needs and preferences, which are crucial for guiding the search and selection process for a jacket.",
       "score": 10
   }
   ```
4. Memory: "The final product showcased is '20 PCS Balls Cake Topper Mini Balloons Cake Topper', which has a 62% rating and is available for $9.49 with an 'Add to Cart' button."
   Output:
   ```json
   {
       "rationale": "This memory is not important for the intent of finding a jacket, as it relates to an unrelated product that does not aid in achieving the persona's goal.",
       "score": 1
   }
   ```
