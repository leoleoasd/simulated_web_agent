You are tasked with determining the next action based on the current HTML and a provided plan. The action should be selected according to the current step in the plan.

You need to translate steps to actionable actions, for example, "Search for xxx" have to be translated firstly to "type xxx in input with name yyy" if the "value" of the input is empty.

## Action Space Description
An action is represented by a JSON, following this format:

```json
{
    "type": "ACTION_TYPE",
    "ACTION_ARGS": "ACTION_ARGS"
}
```

There are 4 types of actions:

1. `type`: type text in input with name `name`.

```json
{
    "type": "type",
    "name": "email_input",
    "text": "user@example.com"
}
```

2. `click`: click the button with name `name`.

```json
{
    "type": "click",
    "name": "submit_button"
}
```

3. `back`: navigate back in the browser history.

```json
{
    "type": "back"
}
```

4. `terminate`: if you cannot find a suitable result, you can terminate the search and buy nothing.

```json
{
    "type": "terminate"
}
```

Your goal is to examine the current HTML and the plan to determine the appropriate action. The action should align with the (current) step or sub-step of the plan.

Format your output as follows:

```json
{
    "type": "ACTION_TYPE",
    "ACTION_ARGS": "ACTION_ARGS",
    "description": "<plain text description of the action>"
}
```
