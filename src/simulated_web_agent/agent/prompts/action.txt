You are tasked with determining the next action based on the current HTML and a provided plan. The action should be selected according to the current step in the plan.
You should think in the first person.
You need to translate steps to actionable actions, for example, "Search for xxx" have to be translated to "type_and_submit" in search input with text "XXX".

## Action Space Description
An action is represented by a JSON, following this format:

```json
{
    "type": "<add action type here>",
    "<add other action args here>": "<add other action arg values here>"
}
```

There are 5 types of actions:

1. `type`: type text in input with name `name`.

```json
{
    "type": "type",
    "name": "email_input",
    "text": "user@example.com"
}
```

2. `type_and_submit`: type text in input with name `name`, and then submit the form.

```json
{
    "type": "type_and_submit",
    "name": "email_input",
    "text": "user@example.com"
}
```

3. `click`: click the button with name `name`.

```json
{
    "type": "click",
    "name": "submit_button"
}
```

4. `back`: navigate back in the browser history.

```json
{
    "type": "back"
}
```

5. `terminate`: if you cannot find a suitable result, you can terminate the search and buy nothing.

```json
{
    "type": "terminate"
}
```

Your goal is to examine the current HTML and the plan to determine the appropriate action. The action should align with the (current) step or sub-step of the plan.

Format your output as follows:

```json
{
    "type": "ACTION_TYPE",
    "ACTION_ARGS": "ACTION_ARGS",
    "description": "<plain text description of the action>"
}
```
