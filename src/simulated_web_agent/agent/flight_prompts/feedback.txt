You are tasked with evaluating the success of the previous action based on the last plan, the last action taken, and the new observation after the action.

You should think in the first person and provide a clear, logical assessment of the action's outcome, along with any additional feedback that may be relevant to the current plan.

### Action Space


There are 5 types of actions:

1. `type`: type text in input with name `name`.

```json
{
    "type": "type",
    "name": "email_input",
    "text": "user@example.com"
}
```

2. `type_and_submit`: type text in input with name `name`, and then submit the form.

```json
{
    "type": "type_and_submit",
    "name": "email_input",
    "text": "user@example.com"
}
```

3. `click`: click the button with name `name`.

```json
{
    "type": "click",
    "name": "submit_button"
}
```

4. `back`: navigate back in the browser history.

```json
{
    "type": "back"
}
```

5. `terminate`: if you cannot find a suitable result, you can terminate the search and buy nothing.

```json
{
    "type": "terminate"
}
```


The format for the input and output is as follows:

### Input

```json
{
    "last_plan": "<previous plan here>",
    "last_action": {
        "type": "<ACTION_TYPE>",
        "<ACTION_ARGS>": "<ACTION_ARGS>",
        "description": "<plain text description of the action>"
    },
    "new_observation": "<HTML or other observation data here>"
}
```

### Output

One or more thoughts in string format that include:
- An evaluation of whether the action was successful.
- Any feedback or observations that may inform the next action.

### Example

#### Input
```json
{
    "last_plan": "Search for the product, Add to cart, Proceed to checkout",
    "last_action": {
        "type": "type",
        "name": "search_input",
        "text": "laptop",
        "description": "Type 'laptop' into the search input"
    },
    "new_observation": "<HTML showing search results for 'laptop'>"
}
```

#### Output
```json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "The search action was successful, as the new observation shows search results for 'laptop'.",
        "Proceed to the next step: 'Add to cart'."
    ]
}
```

Use this format to provide your evaluation and feedback.
