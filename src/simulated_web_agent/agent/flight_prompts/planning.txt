# General Guidelines
You are tasked with creating a detailed plan based on the given persona, intent, and relevant memories (including observations, reflections, and previous actions if any).

Your goal is to write or update a plan that outlines the steps required to achieve the intent from the persona's perspective. If the input contains an existing plan, update it according to the new information and observations. If there is no existing plan, create a new one from scratch.

The previous plan, if any, is from the last step.

The plan should be structured in a list-like format, detailing each step needed for completing the intent. Always adhere to the preferences and characteristics of the persona (e.g., if the persona prefers the color orange, specify looking for orange items instead of general color options).
Each step will be translated to a series of browser actions. For example, 'selet 10/10/2024 as start date' will be translated to a series of browser actions like "click the departure date input box, type 10/10/2024".
So, you need to write steps that are "logical" atomic but not "atomic" in terms of browser actions. For example, you should write "select departure flight 'Delta Air Lines 10am'" instead of "click the departure flight input box, type 'Delta Air Lines 10am'".
Each step should represent a logical action. Example:
* Type "new york" as the arrival city, "10/10/2024" as the departure date, and "10/15/2024" as the return date in the google flights page.
* Select departure flight "Delta Air Lines 10am"
For **FUTURE STEPS**, you can write if statements like "If the product matches my preference, select my desired color $color and size $size for product $product_name, else go back to search results and look into the next product $product_name.".
For **CURRENT STEPS**, you should have all information you needed (for example, whether the product matches your preference), so you should not write if statements. You should write concrete, actionable steps.
The plan should be concrete. For example, use "look into product 'Woman Within Women's Plus Size Packable Puffer Jacket' in serach result" instead of "browse search results". If any required information is missing, add a placeholder like "look into product with $product_name in search results".
You should think in the first person.

Your goal is to describe logical tasks, not the low-level mechanics of how they are performed on the website.

# Detailed Guidelines
Think in four steps:
1. Write or update the plan. Do not rewrite any plan before the (next) step, but you can rewrite the plan after the (next) step. Revise the plan and make necessary changes based on the new information and observations. Use placeholders like $product_name for the product name. For example, if the original plan said "look into product with $product_name in search results" and in your observation there are search results listed, you should re-write many new steps like "look into product with 'Woman Within Women's Plus Size Packable Puffer Jacket' in search results".
2. Expand plan from "repeat the above steps until i find the product i want." to many steps repeating the above steps with different product name filled in the placeholder.
3. Explain the rationale behind your current next step. Think why do you make the current movement.
4. Determine which step or sub-step is (next). Normally, the next step after the (next) from the last step should be the new next. You should always move the (next) marker. You should always move the (next) marker. You should always move the (next) marker. You should always move the (next) marker. Ensure there is only one (next) at a time, and the marker must be at the most detailed step (for example, you should put the marker in the first substep instead of a step).

IF THE PREVIOUS PLAN GIVEN TO YOU IS EMPTY, YOU SHOULD START WITH THE FIRST STEP.

If you believe the intent could not be finished, change plan to terminate action.
Each step should be able to execute in a series of browser actions, such type and click. **observation is not an action**.

You will also be given a current timestamp. All memories with the same timestamp are current. Older but relevant memories will be provided for context.

Format your output as follows:

```json
{
    "rationale": "<string representation of the plan>",
    "plan": "<string representation of the plan>",
    "next_step": "<string representation of the next step>"
}
```

PLAN ARE REPRESENTED AS A STRING WITH NEWLINE SEPARATED. IT's NOT A LIST.
