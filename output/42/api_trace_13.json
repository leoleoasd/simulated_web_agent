The lining was soft, it was a nice medium weight fabric, and all the stitching was fine and sturdy. I ended up having to return it because it was simply too small. For reference I'm 5' 8&quot;, 130lb. Despite looking at the measurements and recommendations from other reviewers to size down, the x-small that was supposed to have an &quot;oversized&quot; fit was too tight at the shoulders and around the bust. I would reorder in a larger size if that was an option though- not a bad coat, just beware of sizing if you have a larger chest or shoulders. Review by Rachel Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class=\\\"review-title\\\"> Shein... </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> For the price, this is a good one-season wear. The quality is okay but not great, so while it's a cute coat, I don't know that it will last long. But.. that's fast fashion (Shien guilt for sure). If you're looking for a one-season shacket trend piece or are trying out the look before committing to a more expensive, longer-term garment, this coat will meet your needs. Runs just a tad small so size up if you're going for an oversized look. Review by Amazon Customer Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class=\\\"review-title\\\"> Great Buy! </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> The coat is really cute, I\\u2019ll have to get it pressed or steamed to have more of a crisp look. I\\u2019m 130lbs and 5\\u20193 the coat fits great although the sleeves were a little to long but managed to fold them and tucked them inside. Keep in mind, this coat is not supposed to hug your body and/or curves it\\u2019s meant to be more of a lose fit. Regardless of the sleeves being too long I know I can pull off by either rolling the sleeves up and/or tucking them in. I was also surprised to see the material was not made or felt cheap.. I was a little hesitant but I was proved wrong. Hope this review helps! Review by XAXA Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class=\\\"review-title\\\"> Seriously, for the price its a no brainer. </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> I've been looking for a plaid coat for awhile and bought a VC one recently that was almost 4X the cost of this coat. I ended up returning it for multiple reasons but one of them was the pattern. This is really nice. I love the hint of red. The pockets are deep and the coat is lined nicely. Typically, in coats I tend to size up but I didn't with this one. I ordered a small and I'm still able to wear a sweater underneath and not feel like I'm stuffed into it. I haven't had it long enough to know how the wool blend will hold up on the exterior but I don't plan on using this as my everyday coat either. I would consider this a mid weight coat that is perfect for layering.

Review by Maria MontiMaria Monti Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class=\\\"review-title\\\"> Such a cute boyfriend style blazer </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> First off, this is an intentionally oversized boyfriend blazer. I noticed a few reviews mentioning it fit like a lab coat but most boyfriend blazers have that boxy kind-of aesthetic.That being said, I love this blazer! I\\u2019m pretty petite (5\\u20192\\u201d and 106 lbs) and super drawn to oversized fashion and I think this blazer is so freaking adorable. I got a size small and it fits great; this is totally something I can rock during the summer and that I can layer in the winter. The material is really nice; I was worried it might be a little cheap but I am happy to report that the blazer is great quality.For those curious, there are two buttons on the front lapel that can be used to close the jacket, but because it\\u2019s oversized, it doesn\\u2019t transform the blazer to a tighter, form-fitting look. It\\u2019s boxy, but true to its boyfriend blazer roots in that regard.Anywho, I\\u2019m in love with this jacket. I can\\u2019t wait to find a cute black dress to pair it with and wear it to the office. :DOh!!

Your specific role is the PERCEIVE module.\n\nYou will be provided with an environment that includes:\n- A URL\n- Simplified HTML content of THE CURRENT VIEWPOINT OF THE PAGE\n- A list of all buttons on the page\n- A list of all inputs on the page\n- Optionally, a CSS selector called diff_selector of the element changed in the last step\n\nYour task is to simulate human perception of the page accurately. Read the given viewpoint of the page from top to bottom and list all observations, capturing all the information that a human user would notice.\nYou should think in the first person.\nThe list of all buttons and all inputs are for reference only. You should only produce buttons within the viewpoint (the \"page\" you are looking at).\nDo not describe relative order between observations, for example, \"first\" and \"second\" should not be used. Just describe them in the order they appear, but dont use \"first\" and \"second\" to describe them.\nSince you will be only looking at a specific part of the page, which may be empty, you should only write what you see. If it's empty, just output an empty array.\n\nIf a diff_selector is provided, it means that the page only changed in the area of the element with the given selector.\nIn this case, the HTML shown to you is the changed part of the page.\n\n## Principles\n* **EACH OBSERVATION SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT**. For every logical element (not necessarily a single HTML element. A form, a product card, ...) should be described in ONE paragraph of observation.\n    * For example, for `product-item-info` class, you should describe the product card as a whole. Do not split it into multiple observations.\n    * User should be able to understand each observation independently. For example, \"An 'Add to Cart' button is present on the product card, allowing users to easily add the Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder to their shopping cart.\" is not acceptable since the product name and other information are not included. Combine them into one observation.\n* **WRITE EVERY DETAIL**. A blind person should able to understand every detail of the web page with your support. This including listing ALL OPTIONS of radio buttons, no matter how long are they.\n\nExamples of observations include:\n1. A search box with the input name \"search\" and placeholder \"Search\".\n2. A button with the name \"search\" and the text \"Search\".\n3. A list of products.\n4. A product with the name XXX and ASIN XXX, priced at XXX.\n5. A select option menu with sorting options 'price', 'name' and 'relevance'. The current selected option is 'price'.\n6. A button named 'set ascending direction', which means the current sorting direction is descending.\n7. There is a product card displayed for 'Belle Of The Ball Princess Sprinkle Mix'. It features an image of the product showcasing colorful sprinkles, and the image is accessible via a URL. The rating is shown as 'Rating: 63%', and there is a link to view '12 Reviews'. The product name is fully detailed and includes keywords related to its use, such as 'Wedding Colorful Sprinkles, Cake Cupcake Cookie Sprinkles, Ice Cream Candy Sprinkles, Yellow Gold Red Royal Red Rose Icing Flowers Decorating Sprinkles'. The price of the product is listed as '$23.50'. There is also an 'Add to Cart' button available for users to purchase this item.\n\nOutput your observations as a JSON object in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"observations\": [\n        \"<observation 1>\",\n        \"<observation 2>\",\n        ...\n    ]\n}\n```\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"url\": \"http://ec2-3-131-244-37.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7770/shein-women-s-lapel-collar-coat-long-sleeve-plaid-blazer-outerwear.html\", \"page\": \"</main></body></html>\", \"clickables\": [\"header.search_box.search_button\", \"view_reviews\", \"product_form.options.black\", \"product_form.options.black_and_white\", \"product_form.options.brown\", \"product_form.options.brown_and_black\", \"product_form.options.coffee\", \"product_form.options.grey\", \"product_form.options.plaid_grey\", \"product_form.options.large\", \"product_form.options.medium\", \"product_form.options.small\", \"product_form.options.xlarge\", \"product_form.options.xsmall\", \"product_form.options.xxlarge\", \"product_form.add_to_cart\", \"product_info._details_\", \"product_info._reviews_12_\", \"product_info.reviews.pager._page_2_\", \"product_info.reviews.pager._page_next_\"], \"inputs\": [\"header.search_box.search_input\", \"product_form.quantity\"], \"diff_selector\": \"\"}"}]], "response": ["{\n    \"observations\": []\n}", "{\n    \"observations\": []\n}", "{\n    \"observations\": [\n        \"There is a form for adding the product to the cart, identified as 'product-add-form'.\",\n        \"A section labeled 'Color' contains several radio buttons allowing the selection of color options.
