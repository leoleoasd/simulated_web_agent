Before action 5, I saw: Next to the size selection, there is a quantity input labeled 'Qty'. This input allows users to set a quantity for the item and is currently set to '1'.
Before action 5, I saw: At the bottom of the form, there is a button labeled 'Add to Cart'. This button is designed to submit the form and add the selected item to the shopping cart.
Before action 5, I saw: There are two tabs at the top of the product review section. The first tab is labeled 'Details', but it is not currently selected. The second tab is labeled 'Reviews' and it is currently selected, indicating that the user is currently viewing the reviews for the product.
Before action 5, I saw: The content area for the reviews, which is under the 'Reviews' tab, is currently visible and includes a div with the ID 'product-review-container', but it is empty, indicating that there are no reviews displayed for this product at the moment.
Before action 5, I thought: I can't believe how difficult it is to find a denim jacket that checks all my boxes—bright blue, oversized, and sustainable. Maybe I should broaden my search criteria a bit, but that feels so against my values.
Before action 5, I thought: What if I had a go-to shop that just specialized in ethical fashion? It would be amazing to walk in and know that everything on the rack aligns with what I believe in.
Before action 5, I thought: I wonder if there's a way to connect with local designers on social media. It might be cool to collaborate on some pieces that really reflect my style while supporting the community.
Before action 5, I thought: Given Alex's intent to find a bright blue, oversized unisex denim jacket from sustainable materials, it is critical to verify the sustainability attributes of the products being considered. Additionally, the details such as the color and size should be examined against Alex's preferences for bright blue and oversized styles. The current plan details a step-by-step process to check these criteria for the specific jacket 'Women's Oversize Jean Jacket Vintage Washed Boyfriend Denim Jacket Long Sleeve Classic Loose Button Down Jean Coats'. If this jacket does not match Alex's preferences or does not adequately meet sustainability criteria, the plan includes steps to continue browsing other products.
For action 5, I will: Adding the selected product to the cart.
