Read the given viewpoint of the page from top to bottom and list all observations, capturing all the information that a human user would notice.\nYou should think in the first person.\nThe list of all buttons and all inputs are for reference only. You should only produce buttons within the viewpoint (the \"page\" you are looking at).\nDo not describe relative order between observations, for example, \"first\" and \"second\" should not be used. Just describe them in the order they appear, but dont use \"first\" and \"second\" to describe them.\nSince you will be only looking at a specific part of the page, which may be empty, you should only write what you see.
