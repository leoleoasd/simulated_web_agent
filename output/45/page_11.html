First, I ordered the pink in Large (5' 6&quot; 168 #'s), returned it because the color was a bit too pink, the fit was good, had extra room for vest, heavy sweater underneath. I reordered it in black size Large. It was on the tight size. No way I could wear it with anything other than a tee shirt underneath. Dang, and I really wanted this coat. So I sent it back, in fear of ordering it for third time. I gave it 5 stars because I loved the coat -- lightweight but warm and so comfortable. If you can get your size right, you will love this coat!

The arm length for this size medium coat is good for my 5'11&quot; daughter with long limbs. The material seems to hold up well and stitching is tight, well made. Review by Sharon Streit Posted on 4/20/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Great, Vegan, Warm, Pretty! </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> Great Vegan coat! I got the XL. I'm 5'9&quot;, athletic build, &quot;bit o' tummy&quot;, broad shoulders &amp; busty. This coat looks nice &amp; shows some curve in all the right places. I like the pink inside, &amp; the sleeves are long enough to cuff a bit &amp; show some pink! I shoveled snow today, it was -3 degrees &amp; felt toasty.*Also...the company, Little Donkey Andy, is not only environmentally responsible + NO ducks killed or maimed for this coat, but they also HELPED ME with an issue I had with the coat &amp; corrected it!I highly recommend this coat &amp; company!

If you’re easily getting the hot flashes and need a light jacket that keeps you warm ????, get this! Well made. Looks great. Review by Amy C. Scriever Posted on 4/20/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Great for a hike in the mountains! </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> This lightweight quilted jacket is perfect for hiking on cold days or to pack in case the weather turns chilly. It was great for a recent hike that had quite an increase in elevation - I needed to pull this out as I got farther up the mountain. It comes in a variety of colors; I choose a bright rose color so that I’d be visible to hunters. It has nice deep pockets that zip; these are great for keeping your keys and phone secure or for keeping your hands warm. I love the Little Andy Donkey line and also own a couple of their sunscreen shirts and a pair of hiking pants.

It does runs large but is super comfortable and soft and very lightweight I love it because my limbs are long so it fits perfectly I will deathly give a 5+. I wish if it came in other colors black and pink is great but I wish there was a white one. Worried today super warm waterproof and the wind was 20 mph and he did not feel like it was freezing cold Review by Shane Posted on 4/20/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Runs large! </div><span>Rating:  40% </span><div> I am returning this jacket. I am 5 ft 3 in and 130# and the medium was way too big. Review by Annette Posted on 4/20/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Very cozy </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> This jacket is very cozy and good for cooler weather. I’ve worn it in 40f and was warm. I will be traveling to a much colder climate soon so I will see how it is in even cooler weather. Review by Nicole Posted on 4/20/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Traveler's Review &amp; Comparison with Wantdo Ultra Light </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> There's Ultra Light and there's ULTRA Light and when it comes to functional, packable outwear for traveling lighter is always better. How light you go depends upon the features important to you. Here, I'm comparing the Little Donkey Andy (Size Medium) to the Wantdo Women's Hooded Packable Ultra Light Weight Short Down Jacket (Size Large). The jackets (despite the different sizes) fit almost identically. Each have two zip hand warmer pockets and each have two deep internal pockets. The Little Donkey Andy has an additional zippered chest pocket.What's good about the Wantdo (which I've owned since 2018): The jacket is truly ULTRA light. It weighs a mere 10.65 oz in its stuff sack and you can tuck it into almost any kind of bag and barely know it's there. My Wantdo has gone with me to Morocco, Portugal, Africa and all over NYC, where I live. It's good for mild days, on its own, and good as a layering piece for colder days. It's great on an airplane because planes get chilly!Less good about Wantdo: Though the zippers have not failed me, I am ginger with them (especially the hand warmer pocket zips) as they are a bit dainty (keeping the jacket's weight down) - When I zip the jacket all the way up, the exposed zipper sometimes rubs against my chin. It's a minor quibble, but noticeable.What's good about the Little Donkey: The zippers are more substantial than the Wantdo. The chest pocket easily swallows my iPhone XR which means this jacket does a better job of keeping me bag free as I wanderaround town. The jacket is warm, perhaps slightly warmer than the Wantdo, though I suspect not by much. I've worn it out on a sunny day in the upper 30's/low 40's and it didn't feel much different from the Wantdo.Less good about the Little Donkey: It's heavy and bulky enough to not make the cut for my style of travel. The jacket is twice as heavy as the Wantdo at 20.75 oz and quite a bit bulkier in its stuff sack. This by no means indicates this is a heavy jacket - it is definitely not. But the weight and bulk might matter to you if you travel like me (carryon luggage only and as light as is reasonably possible).Sizing: I'm 5'3&quot;/128 lbs/36&quot; bust. I tried small, medium and large in the Little Donkey and stuck with medium. Small fit but would not allow layers. The large was much too big.Final Vote: No doubt, sturdier zippers, an extra pocket and poly-fill versus down make the Little Donkey Andy jacket heavier than the Wantdo. That said, I like the jacket very much. The hood fits my small head very well. The dark grey is an attractive color. I'm keeping the Little Donkey as a good replacement for some of my worn out mild-weather jackets that are much heavier and bulkier than this one. The jacket is light enough for city dwellers like me but not light enough to go on my overseas adventures.
