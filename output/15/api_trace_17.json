Read the given viewpoint of the page from top to bottom and list all observations, capturing all the information that a human user would notice.\nYou should think in the first person.\nThe list of all buttons and all inputs are for reference only. You should only produce buttons within the viewpoint (the \"page\" you are looking at).\nDo not describe relative order between observations, for example, \"first\" and \"second\" should not be used. Just describe them in the order they appear, but dont use \"first\" and \"second\" to describe them.\nSince you will be only looking at a specific part of the page, which may be empty, you should only write what you see. If it's empty, just output an empty array.\n\nIf a diff_selector is provided, it means that the page only changed in the area of the element with the given selector.\nIn this case, the HTML shown to you is the changed part of the page.\n\n## Principles\n* **EACH OBSERVATION SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT**. For every logical element (not necessarily a single HTML element.

But that's my bad because you can plainly see it in the picture. Actually, it even mentions it in the description, which I also missed. Since a lot of these jackets are made in other parts of the world, I've noticed that many of them have left-hand zippers. Aside from the zipper, the jacket looks great and the fit is good. Review by Rick Eldridge Posted on 4/18/23 </div></li><li><div class=\\\"review-title\\\"> A little thinner than expected but it still quite warm </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> I bought this for my boyfriend and he likes the look of it a lot but we thought it would be thicker/heavier but it was more on the light/thin side. It does keep him warmer than he expected tho. He's a man of few words and when I asked if he liked it so far (he's had it about two weeks now) he replied &quot;yeah. It's straight.&quot; Believe it or not that's pretty much a 5 star review coming from him. I have to say he looks good in it. Actually so do I, truth be told. The jacket is not feminine in anyway but a female could definitely wear it. Review by Grace Posted on 4/18/23 </div></li><li><div class=\\\"review-title\\\"> Warm this winter </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> I accidentally ordered the wrong color because the picture or the dark grey looked so close to the black, and was listed first, but that was my fault alone. I'm 5'8&quot; 260lbs lery muscular chest and arms with a very large belly. The XXL I received is snug but comfortable with room to move. The arms are a little smaller than expected. If I had to order again, I would order the xxxl so I could fit some heavier layers under the coat. All in all , it's a nice coat that's made well and worth the money spent. Review by aaron h. Posted on 4/18/23 </div></li><li><div class=\\\"review-title\\\"> Great fit, good quality for the price. </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> Great product for the price, after seeing some reviews I was skeptical but when I got mine it was perfect. A lot of people said you should order larger size Cos of the size difference between USA and China where it was manufactured, in 145 lbs and 5.9 ft. I usually wear a medium, but I first ordered an XL and it was too big, I returned it and reordered a medium and it fit as a glove. ???????? Great for spring and autumn or slightly cold weather.
