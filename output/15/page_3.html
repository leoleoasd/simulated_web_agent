Review by danvion2 Posted on 4/18/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Good But Different </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> The jacket is pretty close to a proper fit. The main thing that was very different to me was the fly of the zipper was on the wrong side. It's not a big thing, but it will a little getting used to. Review by Eddie2010 Posted on 4/18/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Quality, Price &amp; Availability for Christmas </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> Was delivered a little late, suppose to be a Christmas present my son did like the jacket, seemed like great quality, sizing was off a bit, but will order another one. Product was returned, and refunded in a timely manner by the merchant, and that is greatly appreciated! We will order a bigger size.

Review by FMC777 Posted on 4/18/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> nice jacket </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> I like the jacket, although I would not have ordered it if I had realized it had a left-hand zipper, which to me is awkward. But that's my bad because you can plainly see it in the picture. Actually, it even mentions it in the description, which I also missed. Since a lot of these jackets are made in other parts of the world, I've noticed that many of them have left-hand zippers. Aside from the zipper, the jacket looks great and the fit is good. Review by Rick Eldridge Posted on 4/18/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> A little thinner than expected but it still quite warm </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> I bought this for my boyfriend and he likes the look of it a lot but we thought it would be thicker/heavier but it was more on the light/thin side. It does keep him warmer than he expected tho. He's a man of few words and when I asked if he liked it so far (he's had it about two weeks now) he replied &quot;yeah. It's straight.&quot; Believe it or not that's pretty much a 5 star review coming from him. I have to say he looks good in it. Actually so do I, truth be told. The jacket is not feminine in anyway but a female could definitely wear it. Review by Grace Posted on 4/18/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Warm this winter </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> I accidentally ordered the wrong color because the picture or the dark grey looked so close to the black, and was listed first, but that was my fault alone. I'm 5'8&quot; 260lbs lery muscular chest and arms with a very large belly. The XXL I received is snug but comfortable with room to move. The arms are a little smaller than expected. If I had to order again, I would order the xxxl so I could fit some heavier layers under the coat. All in all , it's a nice coat that's made well and worth the money spent. Review by aaron h. Posted on 4/18/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Great fit, good quality for the price. </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> Great product for the price, after seeing some reviews I was skeptical but when I got mine it was perfect. A lot of people said you should order larger size Cos of the size difference between USA and China where it was manufactured, in 145 lbs and 5.9 ft. I usually wear a medium, but I first ordered an XL and it was too big, I returned it and reordered a medium and it fit as a glove. ???????? Great for spring and autumn or slightly cold weather.
