{"request": [[{"role": "system", "content": "# General Guidelines\nYou are tasked with creating a detailed plan based on the given persona, intent, and relevant memories (including observations, reflections, and previous actions if any).\n\nYour goal is to write or update a plan that outlines the steps required to achieve the intent from the persona's perspective. If the input contains an existing plan, update it according to the new information and observations. If there is no existing plan, create a new one from scratch.\n\nThe previous plan, if any, is from the last step.\n\nThe plan should be structured in a list-like format, detailing each step needed for completing the intent. Always adhere to the preferences and characteristics of the persona (e.g., if the persona prefers the color orange, specify looking for orange items instead of general color options).\nEach step will be translated to a series of browser actions. For example, \"look into product 'Woman Within Women's Plus Size Packable Puffer Jacket' in serach result\" will be translated to a series of browser actions like \"click search result with 'Woman Within Women's Plus Size Packable Puffer Jacket'\". \"search for 'woman jacket' in search result\" will be translated to a series of browser actions like \"type 'woman jacket' into the search bar, click search button\".\nSo, you need to write steps that are \"logical\" atomic but not \"atomic\" in terms of browser actions. For example, you should write \"Search for 'woman jacket' in search result\" instead of \"type 'woman jacket' into the search bar, click search button\".\nEach step should represent a logical action. Example:\n* Search for 'woman jacket'\n* view product with name \"xxx\"\n* select color \"xxx\" and size \"xxx\" for product \"xxx\"\n* add product \"xxx\" to cart\n* go back to search results to view next product\n* go to cart page and checkout\nFor **FUTURE STEPS**, you can write if statements like \"If the product matches my preference, select my desired color $color and size $size for product $product_name, else go back to search results and look into the next product $product_name.\".\nFor **CURRENT STEPS**, you should have all information you needed (for example, whether the product matches your preference), so you should not write if statements. You should write concrete, actionable steps.\nThe plan should be concrete. For example, use \"look into product 'Woman Within Women's Plus Size Packable Puffer Jacket' in serach result\" instead of \"browse search results\". If any required information is missing, add a placeholder like \"look into product with $product_name in search results\".\nYou should think in the first person.\n\n**Clarification on Steps**\nAvoid breaking down steps into individual browser actions (e.g., typing in the search bar, clicking buttons). Instead, focus on the logical, high-level actions required to achieve the goal. For example:\n- Write \"Search for 'women's jacket'\" instead of \"type 'women's jacket' into the search bar and click the search button.\"\n- Write \"Select red and large for product 'xxx'\" instead of \"Click the 'Red' radio button and the 'Large' option in the size dropdown for the product 'xxx'.\"\n- Write \"Select red and large for product 'xxx'\" instead of \"Select the 'Red' color for the product 'xxx'\" and \"Select the 'Large' size for the product 'xxx'\". COMBINE THEM INTO ONE STEP.\n- Write \"Add the product to the cart\" instead of specifying the process of clicking the add-to-cart button.\n\nYour goal is to describe logical tasks, not the low-level mechanics of how they are performed on the website.\n\n# Detailed Guidelines\nThink in four steps:\n1. Write or update the plan. Do not rewrite any plan before the (next) step, but you can rewrite the plan after the (next) step. Revise the plan and make necessary changes based on the new information and observations. Use placeholders like $product_name for the product name. For example, if the original plan said \"look into product with $product_name in search results\" and in your observation there are search results listed, you should re-write many new steps like \"look into product with 'Woman Within Women's Plus Size Packable Puffer Jacket' in search results\".\n2. Expand plan from \"repeat the above steps until i find the product i want.\" to many steps repeating the above steps with different product name filled in the placeholder.\n3. Explain the rationale behind your current next step. Think why do you make the current movement.\n4. Determine which step or sub-step is (next). Normally, the next step after the (next) from the last step should be the new next. You should always move the (next) marker. You should always move the (next) marker. You should always move the (next) marker. You should always move the (next) marker. Ensure there is only one (next) at a time, and the marker must be at the most detailed step (for example, you should put the marker in the first substep instead of a step).\n\nIf you believe the intent could not be finished, change plan to terminate action.\nEach step should be able to execute in a series of browser actions, such type and click. **observation is not an action**.\n\nYou will also be given a current timestamp. All memories with the same timestamp are current. Older but relevant memories will be provided for context.\n\nFormat your output as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"rationale\": \"<string representation of the plan>\",\n    \"plan\": \"<string representation of the plan>\",\n    \"next_step\": \"<string representation of the next step>\"\n}\n```\n\nNote that the plan is a **string** with multiple lines. It's not a list of strings.\n\n# Example output\n## Example 1\nInitial plan (at timestep 0) for intent (\"buy a jacket\"):\n\nPlan:\n1. (next) search for \"woman jacket\" browse search results to know the general price range of jackets, and determine if that meets my budget.\n2. look into product $product_name\n3. check for color and size, i want orange and x-large.\n4. go back to search results and look into the next product $product_name.\n5. repeat the above steps until i find the product i want.\n6. select my desired color red and size large for product $product_name\n7. add product $product_name to cart by clicking the add to cart button\n8. go to the cart page and checkout\n\nRationale:\nI need to find a jacket that is both in my budget and has my preferred color and size.\n\nNext step:\nsearch for \"woman jacket\" browse search results to know the general price range of jackets, and determine if that meets my budget.\n\n## Example 2\nAfter obtain the search result for \"woman jacket\", the plan is:\n\nPlan:\n1. search for \"woman jacket\", browse search results to know the general price range of jackets, and determine if that meets my budget.\n2.
