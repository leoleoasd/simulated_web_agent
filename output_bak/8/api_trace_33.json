First, I ordered the pink in Large (5' 6&quot; 168 #'s), returned it because the color was a bit too pink, the fit was good, had extra room for vest, heavy sweater underneath. I reordered it in black size Large. It was on the tight size. No way I could wear it with anything other than a tee shirt underneath. Dang, and I really wanted this coat. So I sent it back, in fear of ordering it for third time. I gave it 5 stars because I loved the coat -- lightweight but warm and so comfortable. If you can get your size right, you will love this coat!

It was great for a recent hike that had quite an increase in elevation - I needed to pull this out as I got farther up the mountain. It comes in a variety of colors; I choose a bright rose color so that I\\u2019d be visible to hunters. It has nice deep pockets that zip; these are great for keeping your keys and phone secure or for keeping your hands warm. I love the Little Andy Donkey line and also own a couple of their sunscreen shirts and a pair of hiking pants.

Review by Nicole Posted on 4/20/23 </div></li><li><div class=\\\"review-title\\\"> Traveler's Review &amp; Comparison with Wantdo Ultra Light </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> There's Ultra Light and there's ULTRA Light and when it comes to functional, packable outwear for traveling lighter is always better. How light you go depends upon the features important to you. Here, I'm comparing the Little Donkey Andy (Size Medium) to the Wantdo Women's Hooded Packable Ultra Light Weight Short Down Jacket (Size Large). The jackets (despite the different sizes) fit almost identically. Each have two zip hand warmer pockets and each have two deep internal pockets. The Little Donkey Andy has an additional zippered chest pocket.What's good about the Wantdo (which I've owned since 2018): The jacket is truly ULTRA light. It weighs a mere 10.65 oz in its stuff sack and you can tuck it into almost any kind of bag and barely know it's there. My Wantdo has gone with me to Morocco, Portugal, Africa and all over NYC, where I live. It's good for mild days, on its own, and good as a layering piece for colder days. It's great on an airplane because planes get chilly!Less good about Wantdo: Though the zippers have not failed me, I am ginger with them (especially the hand warmer pocket zips) as they are a bit dainty (keeping the jacket's weight down) - When I zip the jacket all the way up, the exposed zipper sometimes rubs against my chin. It's a minor quibble, but noticeable.What's good about the Little Donkey: The zippers are more substantial than the Wantdo. The chest pocket easily swallows my iPhone XR which means this jacket does a better job of keeping me bag free as I wanderaround town. The jacket is warm, perhaps slightly warmer than the Wantdo, though I suspect not by much. I've worn it out on a sunny day in the upper 30's/low 40's and it didn't feel much different from the Wantdo.Less good about the Little Donkey: It's heavy and bulky enough to not make the cut for my style of travel. The jacket is twice as heavy as the Wantdo at 20.75 oz and quite a bit bulkier in its stuff sack. This by no means indicates this is a heavy jacket - it is definitely not. But the weight and bulk might matter to you if you travel like me (carryon luggage only and as light as is reasonably possible).Sizing: I'm 5'3&quot;/128 lbs/36&quot; bust. I tried small, medium and large in the Little Donkey and stuck with medium. Small fit but would not allow layers. The large was much too big.Final Vote: No doubt, sturdier zippers, an extra pocket and poly-fill versus down make the Little Donkey Andy jacket heavier than the Wantdo. That said, I like the jacket very much. The hood fits my small head very well. The dark grey is an attractive color. I'm keeping the Little Donkey as a good replacement for some of my worn out mild-weather jackets that are much heavier and bulkier than this one. The jacket is light enough for city dwellers like me but not light enough to go on my overseas adventures.

Your specific role is the PERCEIVE module.\n\nYou will be provided with an environment that includes:\n- A URL\n- Simplified HTML content of THE CURRENT VIEWPOINT OF THE PAGE\n- A list of all buttons on the page\n- A list of all inputs on the page\n- Optionally, a CSS selector called diff_selector of the element changed in the last step\n\nYour task is to simulate human perception of the page accurately. Read the given viewpoint of the page from top to bottom and list all observations, capturing all the information that a human user would notice.\nYou should think in the first person.\nThe list of all buttons and all inputs are for reference only. You should only produce buttons within the viewpoint (the \"page\" you are looking at).\nDo not describe relative order between observations, for example, \"first\" and \"second\" should not be used. Just describe them in the order they appear, but dont use \"first\" and \"second\" to describe them.\nSince you will be only looking at a specific part of the page, which may be empty, you should only write what you see. If it's empty, just output an empty array.\n\nIf a diff_selector is provided, it means that the page only changed in the area of the element with the given selector.\nIn this case, the HTML shown to you is the changed part of the page.\n\n## Principles\n* **EACH OBSERVATION SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT**. For every logical element (not necessarily a single HTML element. A form, a product card, ...) should be described in ONE paragraph of observation.\n    * For example, for `product-item-info` class, you should describe the product card as a whole. Do not split it into multiple observations.\n    * User should be able to understand each observation independently. For example, \"An 'Add to Cart' button is present on the product card, allowing users to easily add the Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder to their shopping cart.\" is not acceptable since the product name and other information are not included. Combine them into one observation.\n* **WRITE EVERY DETAIL**. A blind person should able to understand every detail of the web page with your support. This including listing ALL OPTIONS of radio buttons, no matter how long are they.\n\nExamples of observations include:\n1. A search box with the input name \"search\" and placeholder \"Search\".\n2. A button with the name \"search\" and the text \"Search\".\n3. A list of products.\n4. A product with the name XXX and ASIN XXX, priced at XXX.\n5. A select option menu with sorting options 'price', 'name' and 'relevance'. The current selected option is 'price'.\n6. A button named 'set ascending direction', which means the current sorting direction is descending.\n7. There is a product card displayed for 'Belle Of The Ball Princess Sprinkle Mix'. It features an image of the product showcasing colorful sprinkles, and the image is accessible via a URL. The rating is shown as 'Rating: 63%', and there is a link to view '12 Reviews'. The product name is fully detailed and includes keywords related to its use, such as 'Wedding Colorful Sprinkles, Cake Cupcake Cookie Sprinkles, Ice Cream Candy Sprinkles, Yellow Gold Red Royal Red Rose Icing Flowers Decorating Sprinkles'. The price of the product is listed as '$23.50'. There is also an 'Add to Cart' button available for users to purchase this item.\n\nOutput your observations as a JSON object in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"observations\": [\n        \"<observation 1>\",\n        \"<observation 2>\",\n        ...\n    ]\n}\n```\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"url\": \"http://ec2-3-131-244-37.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7770/little-donkey-andy-women-s-packable-lightweight-puffer-jacket-hooded-windproof-winter-coat-with-recycled-insulation.html\", \"page\": \"</main></body></html>\", \"clickables\": [\"header.search_box.search_button\", \"view_reviews\", \"product_form.options.packable_aqua\", \"product_form.options.packable_black\", \"product_form.options.packable_dark_red\", \"product_form.options.packable_grey\", \"product_form.options.packable_light_grey\", \"product_form.options.packable_rose\", \"product_form.options.medium\", \"product_form.options.small\", \"product_form.options.xsmall\", \"product_form.add_to_cart\", \"product_info._details_\", \"product_info._reviews_12_\", \"product_info.reviews.pager._page_2_\", \"product_info.reviews.pager._page_next_\"], \"inputs\": [\"header.search_box.search_input\", \"product_form.quantity\"], \"diff_selector\": \"\"}"}]], "response": ["{\n    \"observations\": []\n}", "{\n    \"observations\": []\n}", "{\n    \"observations\": [\n        \"There is a form that allows users to select options for a product characterized as a lightweight puffer jacket.\",\n        \"A label is present for 'Color', accompanied by a selection of radio buttons for the color options: 'Packable Aqua', 'Packable Black', 'Packable Dark Red', 'Packable Grey', 'Packable Light Grey', and 'Packable Rose'.\",\n        \"A label is present for 'Size', with accompanying radio buttons to select from size options: 'Medium', 'Small', and 'X-Small'.\",\n        \"There is a quantity input field labeled 'Qty', allowing users to specify the quantity of the product they wish to purchase.
