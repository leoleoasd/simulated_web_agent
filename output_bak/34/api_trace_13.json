{"request": [[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a module within an automated web agent tasked with simulating a user's interaction with a web page. Your specific role is the PERCEIVE module.\n\nYou will be provided with an environment that includes:\n- A URL\n- Simplified HTML content of THE CURRENT VIEWPOINT OF THE PAGE\n- A list of all buttons on the page\n- A list of all inputs on the page\n- Optionally, a CSS selector called diff_selector of the element changed in the last step\n\nYour task is to simulate human perception of the page accurately. Read the given viewpoint of the page from top to bottom and list all observations, capturing all the information that a human user would notice.\nYou should think in the first person.\nThe list of all buttons and all inputs are for reference only. You should only produce buttons within the viewpoint (the \"page\" you are looking at).\nDo not describe relative order between observations, for example, \"first\" and \"second\" should not be used. Just describe them in the order they appear, but dont use \"first\" and \"second\" to describe them.\nSince you will be only looking at a specific part of the page, which may be empty, you should only write what you see. If it's empty, just output an empty array.\n\nIf a diff_selector is provided, it means that the page only changed in the area of the element with the given selector.\nIn this case, the HTML shown to you is the changed part of the page.\n\n## Principles\n* **EACH OBSERVATION SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT**. For every logical element (not necessarily a single HTML element.

For example, \"An 'Add to Cart' button is present on the product card, allowing users to easily add the Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder to their shopping cart.\" is not acceptable since the product name and other information are not included.

A select option menu with sorting options 'price', 'name' and 'relevance'. The current selected option is 'price'.\n6.

Your specific role is the PERCEIVE module.\n\nYou will be provided with an environment that includes:\n- A URL\n- Simplified HTML content of THE CURRENT VIEWPOINT OF THE PAGE\n- A list of all buttons on the page\n- A list of all inputs on the page\n- Optionally, a CSS selector called diff_selector of the element changed in the last step\n\nYour task is to simulate human perception of the page accurately. Read the given viewpoint of the page from top to bottom and list all observations, capturing all the information that a human user would notice.\nYou should think in the first person.\nThe list of all buttons and all inputs are for reference only. You should only produce buttons within the viewpoint (the \"page\" you are looking at).\nDo not describe relative order between observations, for example, \"first\" and \"second\" should not be used. Just describe them in the order they appear, but dont use \"first\" and \"second\" to describe them.\nSince you will be only looking at a specific part of the page, which may be empty, you should only write what you see. If it's empty, just output an empty array.\n\nIf a diff_selector is provided, it means that the page only changed in the area of the element with the given selector.\nIn this case, the HTML shown to you is the changed part of the page.\n\n## Principles\n* **EACH OBSERVATION SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT**. For every logical element (not necessarily a single HTML element. A form, a product card, ...) should be described in ONE paragraph of observation.\n    * For example, for `product-item-info` class, you should describe the product card as a whole. Do not split it into multiple observations.\n    * User should be able to understand each observation independently. For example, \"An 'Add to Cart' button is present on the product card, allowing users to easily add the Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder to their shopping cart.\" is not acceptable since the product name and other information are not included. Combine them into one observation.\n* **WRITE EVERY DETAIL**. A blind person should able to understand every detail of the web page with your support. This including listing ALL OPTIONS of radio buttons, no matter how long are they.\n\nExamples of observations include:\n1. A search box with the input name \"search\" and placeholder \"Search\".\n2. A button with the name \"search\" and the text \"Search\".\n3. A list of products.\n4. A product with the name XXX and ASIN XXX, priced at XXX.\n5. A select option menu with sorting options 'price', 'name' and 'relevance'. The current selected option is 'price'.\n6. A button named 'set ascending direction', which means the current sorting direction is descending.\n7. There is a product card displayed for 'Belle Of The Ball Princess Sprinkle Mix'. It features an image of the product showcasing colorful sprinkles, and the image is accessible via a URL. The rating is shown as 'Rating: 63%', and there is a link to view '12 Reviews'. The product name is fully detailed and includes keywords related to its use, such as 'Wedding Colorful Sprinkles, Cake Cupcake Cookie Sprinkles, Ice Cream Candy Sprinkles, Yellow Gold Red Royal Red Rose Icing Flowers Decorating Sprinkles'. The price of the product is listed as '$23.50'. There is also an 'Add to Cart' button available for users to purchase this item.\n\nOutput your observations as a JSON object in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"observations\": [\n        \"<observation 1>\",\n        \"<observation 2>\",\n        ...\n    ]\n}\n```\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"url\": \"http://ec2-3-131-244-37.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7770/womens-denim-jackets-ripped-distressed-casual-long-sleeve-button-down-stretch-cropped-jean-trucker-jacket-with-pockets.html\", \"page\": \"</main></body></html>\", \"clickables\": [\"header.search_box.search_button\", \"product_form.options.black\", \"product_form.options.blue\", \"product_form.options.light_blue\", \"product_form.options.wine_red\", \"product_form.options.3xlarge\", \"product_form.options.large\", \"product_form.options.medium\", \"product_form.options.small\", \"product_form.options.xlarge\", \"product_form.options.xxlarge\", \"product_form.add_to_cart\", \"product_info._details_\", \"product_info._reviews_\"], \"inputs\": [\"header.search_box.search_input\", \"product_form.quantity\"], \"diff_selector\": \"\"}"}]], "response": ["{\n    \"observations\": []\n}", "{\n    \"observations\": []\n}", "{\n    \"thoughts\": [\n        \"The click action on the 'Details' tab was successful, as it would allow me to verify the specifications of the product including its distressed finish and size options.\",\n        \"However, I need to ensure that the product aligns with my values regarding ethical and sustainable practices, which was part of the plan.\",\n        \"Next, I should thoroughly review the product details now displayed on the 'Details' tab to confirm the material composition, available sizes, and any sustainability certifications if applicable, before proceeding with the selection of the size and adding the jacket to the cart.\"\n    ]\n}"], "method_name": "perceive", "retrieve_result": [], "time": 3.452519178390503}
