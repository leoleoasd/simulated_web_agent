The lining was soft, it was a nice medium weight fabric, and all the stitching was fine and sturdy. I ended up having to return it because it was simply too small. For reference I'm 5' 8&quot;, 130lb. Despite looking at the measurements and recommendations from other reviewers to size down, the x-small that was supposed to have an &quot;oversized&quot; fit was too tight at the shoulders and around the bust. I would reorder in a larger size if that was an option though- not a bad coat, just beware of sizing if you have a larger chest or shoulders. Review by Rachel Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Shein... </div><span>Rating:  80% </span><div> For the price, this is a good one-season wear. The quality is okay but not great, so while it's a cute coat, I don't know that it will last long. But.. that's fast fashion (Shien guilt for sure). If you're looking for a one-season shacket trend piece or are trying out the look before committing to a more expensive, longer-term garment, this coat will meet your needs. Runs just a tad small so size up if you're going for an oversized look. Review by Amazon Customer Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Great Buy! </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> The coat is really cute, I’ll have to get it pressed or steamed to have more of a crisp look. I’m 130lbs and 5’3 the coat fits great although the sleeves were a little to long but managed to fold them and tucked them inside. Keep in mind, this coat is not supposed to hug your body and/or curves it’s meant to be more of a lose fit. Regardless of the sleeves being too long I know I can pull off by either rolling the sleeves up and/or tucking them in. I was also surprised to see the material was not made or felt cheap.. I was a little hesitant but I was proved wrong. Hope this review helps!

I ended up returning it for multiple reasons but one of them was the pattern. This is really nice. I love the hint of red. The pockets are deep and the coat is lined nicely. Typically, in coats I tend to size up but I didn't with this one. I ordered a small and I'm still able to wear a sweater underneath and not feel like I'm stuffed into it. I haven't had it long enough to know how the wool blend will hold up on the exterior but I don't plan on using this as my everyday coat either. I would consider this a mid weight coat that is perfect for layering. Review by Happychic Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Disappointed </div><span>Rating:  20% </span><div> I ordered this item based on the measurements provided on page by seller. However, what I received was different from measurements provided by seller. I want to use it now open it, let it be known this was late delivery. That is neither here nor there, what is upsetting is coat is much too small and I am out of money without a remedy.To one’s mind this snacks of false advertising and it is disadvantageous to the buyer who in good faith purchased this item.

Review by RachelAlana Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Cute! </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> This jacket is not a heavy weight type of jacket. It’s lightweight and oversized. I’m 5’2 135lbs wearing a small. Overall I have no complaints, it was exactly what I was looking for.Xosimplylo on I G for more amazon fashion Review by Lauren FuquayLauren Fuquay Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Add to cart! </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> Love this Coat/shacket! Other than a few unraveling threads this is a great layering piece to add to your closet! Not too thick. It’s a comfortable wear, it’s an oversized boyfriend fit.

Review by ElyEly Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Pretty plaid coat great quality! </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> I love it. Ever since I got this I’ve been wearing it everyday for fall weather. It’s just the right thickness for a lightweight coat. It’s not a blazer at all since it’s too heavy and thick. Quality is great and price is affordable so you really can’t go wrong in getting this. Color is more brownish than black. Length is just above the knee. Nice deep pockets so this is perfect for wearing from day to night! Review by Maria MontiMaria Monti Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li><li><div class="review-title"> Such a cute boyfriend style blazer </div><span>Rating:  100% </span><div> First off, this is an intentionally oversized boyfriend blazer. I noticed a few reviews mentioning it fit like a lab coat but most boyfriend blazers have that boxy kind-of aesthetic.That being said, I love this blazer! I’m pretty petite (5’2” and 106 lbs) and super drawn to oversized fashion and I think this blazer is so freaking adorable. I got a size small and it fits great; this is totally something I can rock during the summer and that I can layer in the winter. The material is really nice; I was worried it might be a little cheap but I am happy to report that the blazer is great quality.For those curious, there are two buttons on the front lapel that can be used to close the jacket, but because it’s oversized, it doesn’t transform the blazer to a tighter, form-fitting look. It’s boxy, but true to its boyfriend blazer roots in that regard.Anywho, I’m in love with this jacket. I can’t wait to find a cute black dress to pair it with and wear it to the office. :DOh!! Also, it has pockets!! :DD Review by FictionRebornFictionReborn Posted on 4/19/23 </div></li></ol><div name="product_info.reviews.pager">Page<ul><li class="item current"> You're currently reading page 1 <strong> You're currently reading page 1 </strong></li><li class="item"> Page 2 <a href="http://ec2-3-131-244-37.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7770/review/product/listAjax/id/60186/?p=2" name="product_info.reviews.pager._page_2_"> Page 2 </a></li><li class="item pages-item-next"> Page Next <a href="http://ec2-3-131-244-37.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7770/review/product/listAjax/id/60186/?p=2" name="product_info.reviews.pager._page_next_" title="Next"> Page Next </a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><split-marker/></main></body></html>
